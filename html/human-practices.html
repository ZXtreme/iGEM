        In order to follow the concept of environmentally friendly production and obtain substances that make silk
        anti-bacterial and healthy for people, in December 2021, we wondered more-significance from 3 aspects:
      </div>
      <div class="ans">
        <div class="answer1">
          <img class="lazyload" data-src="../images/human-practices-images/shape.png" alt="">
          <h3>1 What kind of dyes shall we choose?</h3>
          Terpenoids are natural compounds with physiological activity,such as antibacterial properties and healthy
          functions. We also found that some of the terpenes are also natural pigments that are expected to be used as
          coloring agents. So, based on the existing foundation in our laboratory, we chose red lycopene and lightly
          scented patchoulol to develop a dye that can inhibit bacteria. However, no information is available for either
          of them for dyeing silk, so we need to learn more about traditional silk dyes and dyeing techniques.
        </div>
        <div class="answer2">
          <h3>2 How can we produce our ideal silk in an environmental-friendly way?</h3>
          The production of terpenes by synthetic biology method is in line with our concept of environmental
          protection. The simultaneous production of two terpenes not only saves energy, but also reduces the discharge
          of wastewater in the dye extraction industry. Ingeniously, the red lycopene can also be used experimentally as
          a visual screening method for directed evolution. After checking the literature, we learned about the
          pollution hazards of the dyeing industry. So we planned to come to the Saixinglong dyeing factory to learn
          more about the pollution problems of the traditional textile industry.
        </div>
        <div class="answer3">
          <h3>3 What will happen in application scenarios?</h3>
          In terms of daily use, we want to get public acceptance of the production methods and products by presenting
          our projects.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Different stakeholders</h2>
      <div class="stakeholders">
        From silk production to consumption, our stakeholders include silk producers, dyeing factories, garment
        factories, and consumers. After the literature research and pre-experimentation, we conducted an deep
        communication with the stakeholders, hoping to explore the meaning of the project and start the follow-up
        scientific communication work.
      </div>
      <h2>Professional dyers</h2>
      <h5>A research study visit to Saixinglong Company</h5>

        <div class="sub_dyers">
          <img class="lazyload" data-src="../images/human-practices-images/project6.jpg" alt=""> Representing industry
          stakeholder, Saixinglong Company is a textile and dyeing mill, with complete sewage treatment station and
          logistics center, located in Guangdong Province, where silk industry thrives. Our advisor Prof. PU, together
          with a senior engineer from the mill, introduced each parts of the production process to us.We had a close
          look at spinning, weaving, especially dyeing and sewage treating.

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="ask">
        We asked a lot of questions and learned that (traditional dyes are indeed more difficult to degrade in nature,
        but our novel dye, though more eco-friendly, may not be able to bear the high temperature in the hot damp
        educator during the dyeing process. Moreover, the color fading and the preservation of the dye are also
        important issue to think about.) Prof. PU suggested that we should also pay attention to the downstream dyeing
        process beyond biomanufacturing, which may greatly benefit the industry and the application of our technology.
      </div>
      <h2>Consumers</h2>
      <div class="consumers">
        <h5>Project significance and social acceptance survey</h5>
        Among all the stakeholders, the general users are the largest. We conducted an initial social acceptance survey
        for the general public. We included an informed consent form at the beginning of the questionnaire to protect
        the privacy of the respondents. Only after the respondents clicked on the <a
          href="../images/human-practices-images/data-analysis.pdf" class="astyle" download="Data Analysis">consent
          form</a> could they complete the questions related to the project's significance mining, knowledge of dyeing
        industry pollution, and acceptance of synthetic biology methods. Finally, we obtained 304 valid questionnaires.
      </div>
      <h2>Conclusion of the survey results</h2>
      <div class="conclusion">
        <h3 class="res_title">a)mining project significance</h3>
        <p>1. the results of the questions "knowledge of dyeing pollution" show that the public has a certain level of
          knowledge about the pollution in the dyeing industry, so it is feasible to carry out and promote this project.
        </p>
        <p>2. considering the results of questions such as "recommend to friends, microorganisms mind, ideal price", it
          can be concluded that our project has a high level of social acceptance in all age groups.</p>
        <p>3. looking into other applications of the project product: when we brainstormed, we also hoped to apply this
          dye to other scenarios, and the public's answers were related to: wall coating, furniture coating,
          transportation coating, cosmetics, and daily necessities. Their answers not only affirmed the environmental
          significance of our project, but also made us more confident: in the future, these industries are oriented
          towards environmental protection and multi-functional development.</p>
        <h3 class="res_title" style="margin-top:30px;">b)future education content to focus on</h3>
        <p>1. the dyeing industry pollution, synthetic biology production methods are generally less understood.</p>
        <p>2. the acceptance of biological production is lower than that of plant extracts. So, the need for scientific
          knowledge of the process of biological production.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:60px;">Based on the results of the social acceptance survey, we have confirmed the
          feasibility of the project, identified new problems that the project is expected to solve, and hope to get
          proof of concept in the subsequent experiments, and the results of the survey on the understanding of dyeing
          industrial pollution and the acceptance of synthetic biology methods also suggest the focus of the content for
          the subsequent public education.</p>

            provided us with broader ideas, such as applying pigments to scenes such as wall paint and hair dye. So far,
            SCUT-China have set up several offline or online meetings with Prof. Lin, during which we made presentation
            on our ideas and progress, meanwhile exchanging opinion with each other. Besides, the experiment and part of
            the modelling are guided by the students from her laboratory. Understanding that we were having problems
            with directed evolution, Prof. Lin also further supported us the meeting with Biocreatech, a local company
            studying the directed evolution of enzymes.</p>

            emphasized by Zhang, a strain for lycopene should be adapted since the co-expression may lead to the
            decrease of both products. Zhang provided us with 2OZPP, the more-high-yield strain, and we eventually
            obtained a positive result.</p>

            experimental schemes for the antibacterial properties of common products. As a hydrophobic molecule, the
            experimental protocol used in liquid culture is not applicable. Therefore, we eventually intend to use a
            solid plate to carry out MIC experiments. In the investigation process of relevant literature, we found that
            some researchers had conducted similar experiments and obtained good experimental results, which confirmed
            the antibacterial performance of patchoulol, so we did not repeat the experiment. His guidance on inhibition
            experiments helped us to quickly determine the inhibition properties of patchoulol.</p>

            and patchoulol, the technological process and even the application scenario. One of the advisors, Professor

        reality. Thus we grasp every opportunity to share our idea of synthetic biology in sustainable production to the
        public. We advertise the principles and applications of our project to professors and undergraduates majoring
        various research areas in our campus, and residents in all walks of life nearby in the neighborhood. We also
        visit institutions, companies and factories covering the whole production process of a dyed silk, from spinning
        and weaving, the design and production of dyes and enzymes, dyeing and sewage disposal, etc. Besides, to seek
        inspiration and innovative solution to similar problems, we keep in touch with many other iGEM teams to exchange
        ideas and share progress. Also in CCiC forum we attain many feedbacks from our peers to better modified our

        researchers, we demonstrate our design and work in detail for a professional feedback in strategies and
        experiments. For the general public, we prefer to present our promotion video and poster that is easier to grasp
        the idea and focus on more about the applications in daily life. For example, we bring out the topic by
        introducing the damage of textiles, and further expand our potential applications in clothes and cosmetics. This

        learnt a lot from our communication. From our visit to BiocreAtech, our visualization method is considered
        innovative and efficient, and we also learnt that if we are going to put our project to an industrial scale, the
        productivity and quality must be under consideration. In our practice in Tianhe work therapy station, we are
        inspired that maybe our special dyes can be used to make a DIY handcraft kit, or even be used in troves.
        Besides, several professors raise the same potential application in cosmetics, lipsticks. Our dyes can provide
        the lipsticks with bright colors and elegant fragrance from green resource, increasing their competitiveness in
        sustainable development. All feedbacks above went through our careful discussion, and greatly free our mind in

        put forward more proposals after collecting public suggestions, such as furniture dyes, food coloring, lipstick,
        etc. In the future, we will contact relevant manufacturers to discuss the possibility of project cooperation. We
        also plan to extend the blue-light induced dynamic regulation system based on Pichia pastoris in our project as
        a platform to the production of more products, especially some other natural pigments, natural dyes, our
        platform can greatly reduce the production consumption and pollution.</h3>

      <h3>Thanks to Toulouse INSA-UPS, we can reference their ethical matrix to implement our project.<br>To conclude,
        this matrix allowed us to study the impact of our project on its various stakeholders around the values of
        autonomy, justice and well-being. We were able to identify some of the limitations of our project and suggest
        solutions. This ethical matrix allows us to highlight the feasibility of our device from an ethical point of
        view, which is essential for our project.</h3>
