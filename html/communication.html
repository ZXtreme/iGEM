      <span id="over">Overview</span>
      <p>Synthetic biology opens a field of possibilities to solve many issues encountered in society. However, it remains poorly known by most of the population and therefore not yet sufficiently explored. For example, synthetic biology is little exploited in the dyeing industry, although the opportunities are huge. We have observed that this is mostly due to a lack of information and communication on the subject. </p>

          <div class="top">With Prof. Ying Lin</div><p>Professor Yin Lin is our primary PI who majors in enzymology and fermentation engineering. At the beginning of our project design, it was professor Lin who inspired us to refer to dyes in the dyeing of silk. She also provided us with broader ideas, such as applying pigments to scenes such as wall paint and hair dye. So far, SCUT-China have set up several offline or online meetings with Prof. Lin, during which we made presentation on our ideas and progress, meanwhile exchanging opinion with each other. Besides, the experiment and part of the modelling are guided by the students from her laboratory. Understanding that we were having problems with directed evolution, Prof. Lin also further supported us the meeting with Biocreatech, a local company studying the directed evolution of enzymes.</p>

According to his advice, we proposed and processed the idea of light-induced system, which fully improved the gene circuit, regulated the manufacturing, and further completed our project. At the same time, Prof. Ye gave very important guidance on our team's modeling work, and based on his advice, we clarified the direction of our modeling work going forward. Besides, the experiment and project design are also guided by PhDs from Ye's lab.</p>

He mainly made suggestions on the regulation between lycopene and patchoulol, and questioned about the feasibility of plate screening. According to professor Zheng's advice, we promoted the experiment method and further renewed the whole project. Through his previous experience in constructing the metabolic model, professor Zheng also provided adequate advice and conceive on modelling part. As he suggested, the flux balance analysis could not work well when the kinetic data was mostly inaccessible, and the genome-scale model should be made much more sufficient use of. We then renewed the model based on his advice.</p>

During the meeting with us, professor Han mainly focused on the implementation plan, especially the antisepsis property of the Funcdyes. As is stressed, the content of lycopene and patchoulol, and the ratio between them should be carefully testified based on the customer survey. Since the patchoulol may smell like the herb, it is essential to maintain its concentration so that the product can both inhibit the growth of microbes and make the user feel comfortable. She also questioned on the availability in the modelling of light-induced system, which inspired us to promote our project and stress the correlation among all the modules.</p>

The two assistant professors rearranged our experimental logic and pointed out that our wet-lab was relatively fragmented and did not serve our project well.<br>In addition, as for the downstream application of the project, since lycopene is widely used in the food and cosmetics industry, Professor Yang believed that we could expand the application of lycopene to the cosmetics field, such as the production of lipstick, to better show the effect of terpenoid dyes.</p>

We took Professor Liang's suggestion and added more text and illustrations to our defense slides.<br>In addition, as for our experimental data, Prof. Liang recognized the data of our fermentation experiment on the one hand, but on the other hand, Prof. Liang believed that our data processing should be optimized according to our experimental design, and abnormal data should be analyzed and discarded. Professor Liang's suggestion inspired us very well, and we further optimized the experimental data of fermentation.</p>

In the investigation process of relevant literature, we found that some researchers had conducted similar experiments and obtained good experimental results, which confirmed the antibacterial performance of patchoulol, so we did not repeat the experiment. His guidance on inhibition experiments helped us to quickly determine the inhibition properties of patchoulol.</p>

One of the advisors, Professor Yanrui Ye, suggested us to popularize this system to the dye of lipstick. Moreover, various pigments and colors can also be synthesized with the regulation of our co-expression system.

        To better demonstrate our idea to the public, we start from holding some events in our campus and neighborhood, where we have a lot of curious students and local residents. We design the Running Plasmid event which combines synthetic biology education and orienteering, appealing to those who usually lock themselves indoor at weekends to enjoy some warm spring breeze while learning something new in synthetic biology.

      <h3>Participants were encouraged to pick up some stickers by finishing fast quizzes after learning from our posters in certain checkpoints in our campus, with directions on a map. On the stickers are several kinds of parts of a gene circuit, such as promoters, RBS, terminators, target genes and so on. When all quizzes were finished, stickers collected would be able to form a complete plasmid, showing the exact gene circuit we use in our wet lab.</h3>

      <h3>We also invited participants to team up to give a presentation of the previous iGEM project which they were interested in. 7 groups and their theme were listed in the table. Before the end of this winter vacation training, we give some online homework including a screen shot of the Oligo of their designed primers, discourse on literature search for the participants to review what we have learnt theses 2 day. Everyone turned their homework, and some of them asked for our feedback. It was worthwhile and fun to help them learn these skills.</h3>

      <h3>In order to further enhance the influence of our team: SCUT-China 2022 and select the next team members of the next year, we held online interviews this summer vacation. This is not just an interview, but a legacy between iGEMer in our school every year. This year's interview was different from the previous selection mode, we opened our hearts and talked to interviewers about the iGEM in our eyes, what difficulties we encountered in the process of participating in iGEM, and how to overcome them...... Interviewees imagined what they would be like as an iGEMer in the future. And we committed to offer advice on the way they held their brainstorming.</h3>
      <div class="imgbox">
        We also encouraged them: if you choose iGEM, you will encounter many conflicts and difficulties this year. But please believe that if you persist, you will have unexpected rewards. Specially mention: thanks to an association society for biology lovers in our school: BioS. And thanks to SCUT-China 2021 iGEMers for providing us a lot of help.<img class="lazyload" data-src="../images/communication-images/computer.png" alt="">

Prof. Jianwen Ye, also our Secondary PI, invited us to do a presentation in English to share our project to other students. Many students showed their interest and questioned us and we gave our answer. We also shared our life in the lab, which arouse some other students in the class willing to join a lab to feel the experience of doing research. </h3>

      <h2>A Sunny Visit to Kangyuan Therapy Station</h2>
      <h3>After our functional silk was made, we proposed to apply the product to some bio-artwork for both promotion and education. Considering the audience and locational factor, our team SCUT-China together with team LZU-CHINA contacted with Tianhe Kangyuan Therapy Station and successfully held a voluntary event, meanwhile achieving a collaboration in both teams' human practice. </h3>
      <h3>The Tianhe Kangyuan Therapy Station locates in Tianhe, Guangzhou, providing work therapy assistance for the disabled people. The Therapy Station offers daily courses, including liberal education and manual training, to help participants who are mentally ill or retarded to adapt to the current environment and get through the difficulties. With the guidance of the workers there, we have made full preparation and presented a training course with our hand-made silk sample. </h3>

      <h4>Figure 1. The manual material</h4>
      <h3>After ice breaking, we began to perform the tutoring, meanwhile proposing our idea of healthy and green manufacturing. The elegant manual material, including dry flowers, butterfly specimen, and our heart-shaped silk blocks, were warmly appreciated by the participants. Further, those materials were picked up according to their own will, which were then made full use of to create artworks of diverse patterns and splendid imaginations with glue. Before framing, we invited participants to draw and write freely in the margins.

      <h3>The voluntary work received positive feedback from the students and workers there. Besides, we were also suggested to improve the coloring of silk, as some of our products might be a bit faded. All these suggestions will be carefully considered to improve our project. Plus, we also saved an artwork as an example during the tutoring, come and check it!</h3>
